## Installation
You have to do all the steps in order, otherwise the project will not work because the database is not created correctly. If you get an error it will be due to MYSQL server path. For this, you should go to `.\CompanyPanelUI\Startup.cs` and set the database paths in Startup.cs according to your own database. After this step, you need to go to `.\DataAccessLayer\Concrete \Context.cs` and follow the same step. And then open the terminal and follow the steps below in order.

```sh
$ cd .\CompanyPanelUI\
$ dotnet ef database update
